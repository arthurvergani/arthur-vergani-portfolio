                    As Associate Lecturer at Anglia Ruskin University’s Masters in Children's Book Illustration,
                    together with Katherina Manolessou we identified a pattern: talented artists arriving with
                    preconceptions about digital tools that limited their creative possibilities. This course naturally
                    attracts illustrators passionate about analogue techniques who often view digital work as either
                    intimidating or inauthentic. Yet knowing the basics can improve their careers immensely.
                </p>
                <p class="description-paragraph">
                    Rather than forcing software proficiency, I designed a workshop that removes barriers between
                    students and digital tools through animation. Using my design background, I created step-by-step
                    instructions as an interactive Figma prototype, distributed via a dedicated website, and
                    demonstrated live during sessions. The approach prioritises creative play over technical mastery and
                    allows students to create their first animated GIFs within hours, not weeks.
                </p>
                <p class="description-paragraph">
                    After four years, hundreds of animations have come out of this workshop from complete beginners, and
                    fundamentally helped shift the course’s culture. Students now arrive open to seeing digital tools as
                    extensions of their creativity rather than&nbsp;obstacles.
